            This is the inner monologue of the main character for a film I made freshman year. 
            Essentially, the main character is stalking this girl he is obsessed with. 
            He has only seen her from his window but is, for whatever reason, captivated by her. 
            The film has no dialogue, so all the text on screen will be his internalized monologue/a retelling of his decisions.
