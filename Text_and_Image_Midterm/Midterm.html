        <img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
        <div class="image-text">I can barely sleep, I can barely think about anything besides her. I must know her name, I must feel her touch, hear her voice, I need her</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="Image 2" />
        <div class="image-text">My alarm is screaming, my heart is aching, my head is pounding. I know I must get up, she could be up by now. I can’t miss her!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="Image 3" />
        <div class="image-text">The boringness of everyday life, the meander of everyday decisions have swallowed me whole, chewed me up, and spit me out. The outside world is undesirable, for I am protected here, preserved here, yet I find myself isolated here…</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img4.jpg" alt="Image 4" />
        <div class="image-text">I can’t wait to see her, I can’t wait till she joins me in all of this. Till she can embrace me as I have her</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img5.jpg" alt="Image 5" />
        <div class="image-text">Here she comes. My heart pounds every time I see her, a feeling I don't know if I'll ever get used to. This sudden rush of adrenaline. I'm nervous, yet I know there is more than 5000 feet between us, and I can almost feel her.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img6.jpg" alt="Image 6" />
        <div class="image-text">Every day looking more beautiful than the last, I wonder what she sounds like? I wonder what she smells like. It's funny how you can know someone so much from a distance, while simultaneously not knowing them at all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img7.jpg" alt="Image 7" />
        <div class="image-text">As time passed I thought about her, not seeing her, I began to worry. I waited and waited until…</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img8.jpg" alt="Image 8" />
        <div class="image-text">Who the hell is she with? Who is this man? This evil disgusting man is going to take everything from me. He is going to take what is mine.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img9.jpg" alt="Image 9" />
        <div class="image-text">I panic and pack what I need. As I rush out the door, I know what I must do..</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img10.jpg" alt="Image 10" />
        <div class="image-text">I can’t believe she wants to throw this all away, she must not know what she means to me, what I can mean to her, for her. Either way, I know what I must do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img11.jpg" alt="Image 11" />
        <div class="image-text">My heart is pounding, my fists are trembling, my knees are weak, my stomach feels empty, as I can barely stand what I am about to do. What I… have to do. As I knock, I know that my decision and my choices are final.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/img12.jpg" alt="Image 12" />
        <div class="image-text">I drop my bag as I am stunned by her beauty. However, I know something so amazing can’t be around forever. As I take my next step, I do what I must.</div>
